1. The *null conditional operator* allows for null values to be detected more elegantly.

1. The *null coalescing operator* ensures that you donâ€™t include null values in the results displayed in the browser by combining it with the *null conditional operator* to set a fallback value.

1. 
    * The *null conditional operator* allows for values to be null without the error-prone and tedious issues.
    * Nullable types are a feature of some programming languages that allow the value to be set to the special value NULL instead of the usual possible values of the data type.

1. Yes, the value can be changed later. Yes, another value can be assigned. The value can be changed in the constructor.

1. 
    * An *object initializer* allows the creation an object and specify its property values in a single step.
    * A *collection initializer* allows the creation of a collection and its contents to be specified in a single step.

1.  The *is* keyword is used to perform a type test

1. Extension methods are defined in static classes within the same namespace as the class the extension methods applies to.

1. *Implicit typing* or *type interference* is how the var keyword allows you to define a local variable without explicitly specifying the variable type.

1. *Asynchronous methods* perform work in the background and notify you when they are complete, allowing your code to take care of other business while the background work is performed. They are an important tool in removing bottlenecks from code and allow applications to take advantage of multiple processors and processor cores to perform work in parallel.

1. Yes, when you use the *await* keyword, you must add the *async* keyword to the method signature.

1. The *yield* keyword is used in an iterator block to provide a value to the enumerator object or to signal the end of the iteration. When used the expression is evaluated and returned as a value to the enumerator object.

1. The *nameof()* expression is used so the compiler takes responsibility for producing a name string.
